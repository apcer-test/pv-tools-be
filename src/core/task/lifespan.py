    This function reads a private RSA key from a specified file and stores
    it in the application state for later use. It ensures that the RSA key
    is properly loaded into the application state before yielding control to
    the application and does not perform any cleanup actions upon exit.

    Args:
        app: The application instance, which can be used to store
             application-level state and configurations.

    Yields:
        None: Control is yielded back to the application, allowing it to
              run while the RSA key is available in the app state.
